# resty-stone

Rest API toolkit for KeystoneJS.

A powerful and robust toolkit for building Web API`s.

Click here for [Documentation](http://shlomiassaf.github.io/resty-stone)

####See [example](https://github.com/shlomiassaf/resty-stone/tree/master/example) directory to understand how to init a basic REST.

## Key features:  
 - __Works out of the box__  
 resty-stone requires only metadata, tell it what a resource can or cant do, it will take care of the "REST".
 
 - __REST Domain__    
 resty-stone create a new layer of metadata to control the behavior of List instances.  
 The allows a high level of customization per List instance/group.
 
 - __Token based authentication__  
 resty-stone comes with built-in support for __Basic Auth__ authentication built on top of KeystoneJS authentication.  
 This means separate auth modules but same behavior.
 
 - __Highly customizable__      
 resty-stone lets you control the behavior of your List or let it do its magic automatically.  
 Customize fields, request handling, serialization, filtering, custom remote functions and more.
 
 - __Relay on KeystoneJS building blocks__     
 resty-stone uses KeystoneJS infrastructure where possible.  
 This helps keeping performance aligned and creates a unified experience.
 
 - __AdminUI separation__  
 resty-stone create a clear separation between AdminUI configuration and REST domain configuration.


##Install
```
npm install resty-stone --save
```


## Example  
Lets demonstrate a simple WebAPI for the model Post in a KeystoneJS blog.  
We will expose the model `Post` as a resource, it will:  
  - Be a read only (HTTP GET) access for all users (unauthenticated & authenticated).  
  - Expos Only Post instanced with a state = 'published'.  
  - Show only 3 columns: title, slug and content.brief
    
First, define the metadata for the resource:
```
module.exports.default = {
    "httpMethods": "get",
    "defaultKey": "slug",
    "permanentFilter": "state:published",
    "columns": {
        "visible": [
            "title",
            "slug",
            "content.brief"
        ]
    }
}
```
We will save this file in `./rest_model/Post.js`

Now, in the startup file for our app (keystone.js) we will initialize resty-stone:
```
var keystone = require('keystone');

/*
        Keystone init code here...
*/

var restyStone = require("resty-stone")(keystone); 
keystone.set('resty api base address', "/api");
keystone.set('resty meta location', "./rest_model");
keystone.start(restyStone.start());
```

Now browse to `http://www.yourapidomain.com/api/posts`, you should see:
```
{
    "success": true,
    "resultType": "array",
    "modelType": "Post",
    "result": [
        {
            "_id": "5480b21f7a43bca82c1d34e8",
            "slug": "hello-world",
            "title": "Hello World!"
            "content": {
                "brief": "this is a short brief for hello world post!",                
            }
        },
        {
            "_id": "6535b25375435ca52c1444e1",
            "slug": "hello-world-2",
            "title": "Hello World#2!"
            "content": {
                "brief": "this is a short brief for hello world #2 post!",                
            }
        }
    ],
    "pagination": {
        "total": 2,
        "currentPage": 1,
        "totalPages": 1,
        "pages": [
            1
        ],
        "previous": false,
        "next": false,
        "first": 1,
        "last": 2
    }
}
```


##TODO:
- Implement nested List handling.
- Support more authentication policies (OAuth1, OAuth2)
- Auto-generate client (native js, angular)?
